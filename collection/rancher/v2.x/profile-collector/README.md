# Rancher v2.x profiles-collector

## Notes

This script is intended to collect:
- [Golang profiles](https://github.com/pkg/profile) for [Rancher Manager](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/), Rancher Cluster Agent, Fleet Controller and Fleet Agent
- Rancher debug or trace logs when collecting Rancher profiles
- Rancher audit logs when available
- Events from the cattle-system namespace
- metrics with kubectl top from pods and nodes
- Rancher metrics exposed on <RANCHER_URL>/metrics

## Usage

The script needs to be downloaded and run with a kubeconfig file pointed to the local Rancher cluster or a downstream cluster where cattle-cluster-agent pods are running

### Download and run the script
* Save the script as: `continuous_profiling.sh`

  Using `wget`:
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/master/collection/rancher/v2.x/profile-collector/continuous_profiling.sh
    ```
  Using `curl`:
    ```bash
    curl -OLs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/master/collection/rancher/v2.x/profile-collector/continuous_profiling.sh
    ```
 
* Run the script:
  ```bash
  bash continuous_profiling.sh
  ```
  The script will run until it receives a SIGKILL (Ctrl-C)
  A tarball will be generated at the same folder where the script is running. Please share that file with Rancher support.
